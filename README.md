# intellistrip
A smart powerstrip management

This strip uses a raspberry pi or beagle bone black (or another thing that has GPIOs via SYSFS).
It controls one or more relays connected to standard plugs.
It monitors temperature, humidity, light, and just about anything else.

depending on what it's monitoring, it can turn things on and off.

the goal is to use it for winter gardens, green houses or other automation projects.
